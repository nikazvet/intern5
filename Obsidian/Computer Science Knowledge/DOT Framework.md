DOT Framework is a research framework often used in Applied Science universities in the Netherlands. When doing something, people often do applied research. 

## What

When you have a goal in mind and existing research, in between the innovation happens. 

## The "Why" of your research

Explaining what you want to obtain with your research will help you to better structure your research. If you do research in the application context your reason for research will probably be to obtain a product which is relevant for the stakeholders. You are trying to optimise the **fit** between your product and the application context. Oftentimes you want to assure that your product is up to contemporary quality standards. In those cases you want to use all the **expertise** available to create your product. You do this by doing research in the "available work" domain. As there are few methods that simultaneously optimise fit and expertise it is often needed to combine both types of methods in the project.

Similarly there is a tradeoff between optimising **overview** and **certainty**. Often, mostly in the beginning you want to gain a good overview over what is needed or what is available. At other times you want to test specific aspects of your work, making sure it works. In these cases you try to configure your research to optimise "certainty" about your hypotheses or goals.

Lastly, in most cases your research might require a **data** oriented approach to justify your choices, prove completeness and so on. Sometimes, however, it is a good idea to choose a more **inspiration** based method, like the [Brainstorm](https://ictresearchmethods.nl/Brainstorm "Brainstorm") method.

## How (strategies and methods)

### [[Library]]

What already exists, so whole products that can be used, and methods, theories, guidelines that can help. Don't reinvent the wheel.

### [[Field]]

Explore context. Get to know your end users, your client, and when and where your product is gonna be used.

### [[Lab]]

Test the final product. Does it work as it should? Test different scenarios.

### [[Showroom]]
Show, test and compare your product to existing ones
### [[Workshop]]

Explore opportunities. What is possible? Get other peoples' ideas.
