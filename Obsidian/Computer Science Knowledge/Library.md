Method from [[DOT Framework]]
What already exists, so whole products that can be used, and methods, theories, guidelines that can help. Don't reinvent the wheel.

## Available product analysis

Was it already done?

In the context of [[PVI]], I can use this method to find existing vulnerabilities and exploits, on outdated versions of Firefox or ones that couldn't be patched and fixed.

## Best good and bad practices

What is considered best practice?

Follow guidelines, gather discuss and use the information.

In the context of [[PVI]], I can use this method by following OWASP guidelines for testing websites and programs.

## Community research

Use your community and peers, what have they already done?

In the context of [[PVI]], I have already done this while fishing for ideas. I will do this again for conducting research. Also for formatting and presenting my research and on use of DOT framework itself.

## Competitive research

What niche is empty? How am I unique?

## Design patterns

Find and use good design patterns, there are books, there are articles, etc.

## Expert interview

Get a grip and more relevant information with help. 

In the context of [[PVI]], I could talk to professors and maybe find a person has hacked Firefox or other browser. 

## Literature study

Main method in this internet age. Using google is an important skill in any field and in everyday life.

Make a plan, write down big, important words. Find and judge material. Find words and opportunities to go deeper. Finally, select which materials to read in detail, plan the reading and summarise your findings during reading.

I will be using this in [[PVI]]

## SWOT analysis

A strategic tool for evaluating decisions. Write down Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats
