# Project Plan

### Context and background <a href="#_toc144717091" id="_toc144717091"></a>

My internship project is within the IXD lectorate at the Fontys TQ building. Project Building Attention is focused on improving the TQ building for students and visitors. This building is home to Advanced semesters, Specializations, Minors and Open Learning. The building also houses researchers. Within the Building Attention project researchers and interns think of ways to improve the experience of learning, working, and innovating at TQ. 
My assignment focuses on 
I will be studying the reasons people fail at Fontys and how these failures can be remedied. Compared to R10, TQ houses more experienced students that are more familiar with applied research and feedback structure having gotten used to it in the first three semesters. At Fontys, the further you go, the more freedom and control you have of the moments of contact, deliverables etc.; the more unbound and closer to real work you are. For most people organizing themselves and understanding the way their work is assessed is difficult, especially when assessment and standards change every semester.

### Current situation / problem analysis <a href="#_toc144717092" id="_toc144717092"></a>

[[Asking for help]] doesn't fit here because it is its own situation.
Several semesters ago a group of students developed an app with requests for help formulated as quests. I was brought on to fix the bugs that stopped the app from working. However, after I studied the app and its creators’ research and documentation, I realized that my views of what helping means and what is most important about it differ from theirs. The app framed helping as a competition, something you earned points for and could be best at. At the same time it deemphasized personal interaction: the developers wrote in their advisory document of “the lack of a proper ‘gamified’ user experience that enhances a community”. Gamified elements can be powerful when applied correctly and depending on what direction my project takes, apply or borrow them where appropriate.
While at TQ students deal with a lot of audible and visual noise. Part of my task is ensuring that my project and requests for help that particular students can't answer don't add to the noise.
Inside TQ there are different educational and social environments, some more and some less encouraging and nurturing. A good project group can greatly improve a student's semester and development.
There are different situations one can classify as failures such as: situation where a student doesn't show up to [[Asking for feedback|feedback moments]] and then delivers all the work at the very end; some students get lackluster, discouraging feedback during the moments; some people deliver work, but don't show up enough, deliver it in large chunks and can't get good feedback because professors don't know them and their work well enough yet; there are also people who are not aware of the requirements and deliver rogue products in weird shapes; feedback can also be surface level and unsatisfactory sometimes, then comes final assessment and unpleasant surprises, although this last one can just be my anxiety speaking.
### Expectations, Goals & possible result <a href="#_toc144717093" id="_toc144717093"></a>

The goal of this project is to design a platform to enable students in TQ to help and get help to and from peers and educators in order to complete projects faster. A help network would improve student well-being by building and strengthening connections and reducing shame, stress and loneliness. The platform which I aim to build would allow students to overcome shame, stubbornness and other bad feelings associated with needing help. As the main challenge of the previous project was getting helpers on the platform, I will also take steps to make sure they are welcome, supported and rewarded in an encouraging way.

The other alternative goal, I came up with after some brainstorming

### Research questions (+/- 5) <a href="#_toc144717094" id="_toc144717094"></a>

I could come up with something! Here could go all the questions that went into personas and some synthesized or past ones. I do have a document for these: [[Research questions]]
