# Project Plan

### Context and background <a href="#_toc144717091" id="_toc144717091"></a>

My internship project is within the IXD lectorate at the Fontys TQ building. Project Building Attention is focused on improving the TQ building for students and visitors. This building is home to Advanced semesters, Specializations, Minors and Open Learning. The building also houses researchers. Within the Building Attention project researchers and interns think of ways to improve the experience of learning, working, and innovating at TQ.

### Current situation / problem analysis <a href="#_toc144717092" id="_toc144717092"></a>

students struggle with asking for help

bother their peers and professors

unaware of common problems or people with relevant expertise.

shame.

Several semesters ago a group of students developed an app with requests for help formulated as quests. I was brought on to fix the bugs that stopped the app from working. However, after I studied the app and its creators’ research and documentation, I realized that my views of what helping means and what is most important about it differ from theirs. The app framed helping as a competition, something you earned points for and could be best at. At the same time it deemphasized personal interaction: the developers wrote in their advisory document of “the lack of a proper ‘gamified’ user experience that enhances a community”

research and develop an application that both helpers and people in need will use after I finish my project and the novelty wears off.

### Expectations, Goals & possible result <a href="#_toc144717093" id="_toc144717093"></a>

The goal of this project is to design a platform to enable students in TQ to help and get help to and from peers and educators in order to complete projects faster. A help network would improve student well-being by building and strengthening connections and reducing shame, stress and loneliness. The platform which I aim to build would allow students to overcome shame, stubbornness and other bad feelings associated with needing help. As the main challenge of the previous project was getting helpers on the platform, I will also take steps to make sure they are welcome, supported and rewarded in an encouraging way.
