I'm glad that I'm more clear on my desires for this project because on second thought the project proposal seems wishy-washy. I need to reread and rewrite it compassionately.  
# Project proposal
The main goal of the project is to make people start, but I am also interested in the middle and end of the two processes: one-time help and continuous (educational) exchange. The main questions are:
How can we get people onto the platform and helping?
How can we retain user attention after novelty wears off?
The sub questions are:
How can a platform make asking for help easier for students?
How can we encourage people to help with IT means?
What advice can I give on non-IT support? Non-IT support itself is out of scope.
How can we reward students for participating in the exchange? Should we?
How can we support students through helping, so that helpers can ask for help too?
How do we make this solution sustainable?
What ends somebodyâ€™s participation in the exchange?
What ends the exchange itself?
