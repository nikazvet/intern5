## Sociological side

- What is helping?
- Not a competition
In my opinion there are several components that make helping possible. Fontys is a space that is populated by people. This makes it an environment, dictates the sorts of interactions that are possible. We are all here to learn. Some people have more knowledge in some areas than others. If you have a problem there is a not small chance that somebody else has already dealt with a similar problem before. If you have several questions on an area of knowledge , want to deepen your understanding of it, there likely is an expert on it, a person who can share their knowledge, that you can have a conversation with. For common tasks like documenting research there are a lot of approaches, while your coach/assessor/whatever is your primary authority on what you should do, knowing what others have done, both peers in higher semesters and lower, seeing and discussing completed and in progress works has value. This pretty extensive paragraph is what I have learned about Fontys, what it is/can be/should be about. This is what I will be referring to as a **learning environment(LE)** that I want to facilitate and make more accessible. I formulated this conception of LE in my Open Learning third semester and while observing the Spring 23 interns. Being friends, sharing projects with each other and sharing problems, having an open and safe environment are great things.
