### Questions

There are some questions I need to answer before formulating real research questions

#### What is my audience, primary beneficiaries?

The primary beneficiaries of my project are students who would otherwise not pass the semester. Students who don't know who to turn for help to, those who tried helping or asking for help and ended up worse of or not substantially better.

#### What are my goals and hopes for the project

I want to increase the number of students who pass and their overall happiness. I also hope that these students could benefit from a website or a game. They can benefit from a mini-game that helps take your mind off things.

#### Why do students fail?

What are the reasons that students fail semesters? What kinds of failure are there? What is the scale on which they belong? How can we define failure better?

#### What should a student who lacks knowledge do?

What kinds of ignorance and lack exist and matter to us?

### Previous team takeaways

Custom rewards are nice because people like to feel appreciated. A way to assemble a token would be nice. Part of that project was to help people orient at TQ. For me maps would be nice, but they are probably out of scope.

### Research tasks in more detail

#### Who are my stakeholders?

Marc is, once I talk to him I will have involved all stakeholders

#### Why is this a problem worth solving?

I want people to succeed at Fontys, graduate and get well-paid jobs they want/need.

#### Why does this problem exist?

I believe that the reasons this problem exists are: the total isolation of people facilitated by capitalism, the promise of class mobility that is promised by Fontys, Fontys's goal to fail students to give people who pass value and collect money, unclear communication, the course load being too much when you are already dealing with problems.

#### I need to formulate questions before I verify them

#### Narrow down the class I want to experiment on
