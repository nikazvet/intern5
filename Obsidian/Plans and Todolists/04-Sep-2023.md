Today I have no meetings.
I have two documents, meetings and additional work I need to take care and track of. Thus I create and split my general todolist into three parts: competence document, project plan and research.

# To-do lists
## Competence document
- [x] Copy down competence document
- [x] Rewrite introduction
- [x] Fill in current profile
- [x] Find and check my Final-Final profile
- [x] Empty the KPI table
## Project Plan
- [x] Start on template for project plan
## Research
- [ ] Create a plan for interviews
- [ ] Create a research document
- [ ] Observe some days and lectures
- [ ] Narrow down additional objectives
- [ ] Conduct a thorough investigation
- [ ] Verify the question
- [ ] Why?
- [ ] Talk with all stakeholders

## Research in initiation phase
I copied down some things from the PowerPoint
- Investigate the situation more thorough;
- Verify the problem, question, the “WHY” ;
- Involve more (all!) stakeholders;
- Dig deeper.. turn every stone;
- Immediately create research/source documentation!
