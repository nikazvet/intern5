Today there is 
# To-do lists
I have two documents, meetings and additional work I need to take care and track of. Thus I create and split my general to-do list into three parts: competence document, project plan and research.
## Competence document

## Project Plan

## Research

## Research in initiation phase
I copied down some things from the PowerPoint
- Investigate the situation more thorough;
- Verify the problem, question, the “WHY” ;
- Involve more (all!) stakeholders;
- Dig deeper.. turn every stone;
- Immediately create research/source documentation!
