Also, [The Eye](<The Eye.md> "mention"), a page for this wonderful voice in my head that worries about optics and is going crazy without quality human time. All these stories are about abandonment(just like the podcast I listen to. I want to find more podcasts that can help refine this concept in my mind and see if I can apply it on a smaller scale or more to my situation.) to a different degree, but the story most about it belongs to a student I feel the guiltiest about (guilt is a bad motivator, so I want to get rid of it).

A humble knight, a lonely girl... You have nice and descriptive names for yourself already, very humble and so vulnerable. What about your friends than? How many ways can you say foreigner in fantasy land speak? Who says I need to? More honestly, this language is not the most appropriate for this goal, but it is cool. Storybook, right? It is a lofty goal to not sound xenophobic while leaning on fantasy tropes for this. Read up or talk about this stuff somewhere, right? Images of myself call up such vivid pictures, both of them raced. This is a raced issue. And these personas will make good RPG characters once they are done. We just need an eclectic enough universe to contain all of them. "The west" is eclectic enough for this with all the myth building that is going on. I have characters that I haven't worked on in years in a different folder. I want to learn how to do AI art to illustrate these concepts.
