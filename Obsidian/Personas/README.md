# Personas

The student who was abandoned by several institutions in his university life, but still continued working in unorthodox ways that I fucking hope gave him a passing grade. I need to ask Ingrid to help me write an apology letter that is "normal" and not as me. His persona can be called [Unorthodox Success](Unorthodox%20success.md "mention"). I am a humble knight who wants to better and protect the people of this world, with a lot riding on her shoulders and nobody there, not to talk to, nor to help - but to judge unworthy. Atlas is a bad name, but I want to investigate why for self-help reasons. I would call it [Knight.md](Knight.md "mention")perhaps. And split the fear of [Judgement.md](Judgement.md "mention") off into a separate thing. For Tuan, he needs a persona too. I want to talk to him about it. Long distance, travel, time, work. [The Clock](<The Clock.md> "mention") Sometimes, I've been in those positions, you're just not likable enough to get a slice of work good enough to pass. Andrei and Paakow were the kind of people. who were not taking this stuff seriously enough. [Last to the table](<Last to the table.md> "mention") is a title that is not all one word.

# People
I talked to Ariana(?) about the time she had to retake a semester. She didn't like it because it was boring and very different from the usual more practice oriented changes.
