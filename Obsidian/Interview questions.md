Phase: Planning
---
Good afternoon, my name is Veronika. I am doing a project for the Lectorate. Thank you for agreeing to talk to me. My project is related 

1. Have you ever struggled with technical problems?
2. Have you ever asked __ for help?
	1. professors
	2. coaches
	3. student+ people
	4. peers
	5. more experienced students
3. How helpful was it?
4. Would you ask that same person for help again?
5. Would you seek out the category's help again?
6. How did you know to ask them?
7. Have you ever been reluctant to ask for help? Why?
8. Have you ever been provided bad help or felt uncomfortable while helping?
9. Whom did you turn for help to during last semester?
10. What is the most common thing you need help for?
11. What is the thing you most often help with?
12. 

How personal and "diggy" should the questions be? Is it better to have more input boxes or more numbers and rankings?
