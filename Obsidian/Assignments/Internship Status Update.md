You make an agreement with your Fontys internship coach on with what communication means and how frequent you are going to provide him/her status of progress updates. Important matters to communicate are:

What have you been doing the past week and does it fit within your total planning?

What activities you are planning to do the coming week?

What problems have you encountered and where do you possibly need help?

In this Canvas assignment you can weekly upload a new file until the end of your internship. The old files will remain visible. Your Fontys internship coach will provide feedback if this is required. Alternatively you can use FeedPulse for this. Agree with your coach what works best.
